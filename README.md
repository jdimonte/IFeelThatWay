## Overview
### Description
Anonymous forums for women discussing common problems and solutions. An environment for advice from other individuals on issues related to your period, your relationship, or anything you are struggling with. This is a space to get relief about your feelings, knowing you are not alone.

### App Evaluation
[Evaluation of your app across the following attributes]
- **Category:** Mental Wellbeing and Social
- **Mobile:** There is reacting and commenting, which is perfect for a mobile environment.
- **Story:** Targets individuals who have new or uncomfortable feelings and want to see if there are others who feel the same way. They are also seeking advice on these issues or being relieved that these feelings are normal.
- **Market:** It is targeted for women, so the market is more than half of the population. It is welcome to anyone who is interested in reading the answers and  advice for these issues.
- **Habit:** It will be more popular if new content is regularly posted, and as long as users have questions. It could also be easy to read in the morning or at night, just wondering the various prompts and comments.
- **Scope:** Doable, based on what we will learn in this course, the time for working on the app, and the support for research the new features.
